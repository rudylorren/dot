==================================

Neverwhere:

When Richard Mayhew stops one day to help a girl 

he finds bleeding on a London pavement, his life 

is forever altered, for he finds himself propelled 

into an alternative reality that exists in a 

subterranean labyrinth of sewer canals and abandoned 

subway stations. He has fallen through the cracks 

of reality and has landed somewhere different, 

somewhere that is Neverwhere.
